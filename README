This is a WIP utility which can notify or fetch mails from EE webmail :
http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/webmail/src/login.php

Why I'm writing this?
Because I failed to configure POP access to EE server from gmail . Tried many times! :(

The crawling idea is built from the source of  Moodle-Sync app ny @anilshanbhag 
It is available at https://github.com/anilshanbhag/Moodle-Sync/
